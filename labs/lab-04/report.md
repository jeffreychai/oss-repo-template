## 2 - Four Criteria

The four criteria of free software are

Freedom 0 - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

Freedom 1 - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.

Freedom 2 - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.

Freedom 3 - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

## 3 - Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license in order to have rights over your project and your intentions for its use.
A license allows for distribution of work while also retaining ownership.
Having a license that allows for a community of collaborators is the only way to safely work on an open source project.
If there is no license, there is potential for any collaborators to claim ownership.

## 4 - Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

It is important that you should not use a project that does not have an explicit license because there is no guarantee that it is open source.
Additionally, it can lead to issues in the future because no singular entity actually owns the rights.
If someone were to do work on a project, the creator could even claim copyright on any of that.

## 5 - Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.

I agree with the claim because the Web product is still used today while not many people today know about Gopher.
The reason Web beat Gopher is because of more public support following the idea of "release early, release often" where users can provide feedback.
Another one of Gopher's failures include not providing hyperlinks, which Web did have.

## 6 - Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

When it comes to choosing a license, there is no one size fits all solution.
This is because it depends on the exact needs and intentions behind the project.
One example of this is why Linux uses the GPL v2 license.
Unlike other mainstream operating systems such as Windows, Linux is open source.
Being open source, it has been popular with the developer community as there is transparency.
Since the GPL v2 license is a copyleft license, this means that anybody who tries to repurpose the code is required to fall under the license.
This prevents for-profit corporations from exploiting the hard work of developers.
Thus, the GPL v2 strikes a perfect balance by allowing the developers freedom to create new features while not allowing corporations to restrict access to version of Linux that are developed.
This matches the history, goals, and philosophy of the project since the principal author of Linux believed that "open source is the only right way to do software".
Additionally, one of the core reasons Linux is successful is because the existing user base highly approves of it due to its open source nature.

Breakout Room 7 Link: https://github.com/schnur/RPIduino

Our business idea is to create open source circuit designs for education.
It would work as a business since we can profit by selling kits with all the parts.
We decided to go with the GPL v3 license since the purpose is aimed toward education, so any future contributions should be made open source as well.
