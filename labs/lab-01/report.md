### (1) Open Source Definition
The 10 criteria of Open Source are:
      1. Free Redistribution
      2. Source Code
      3. Derived Works
      4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
      5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
      6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
      7. Distribution of License
      8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
      9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
      10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
      
The definition of open source is important because it outlines the general criteria of what it means to pursue this kind of project.
Open source is important for many reasons educational and beyond, so understanding this is important in order for it continue into the future.

### (3) How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way:
This article goes over how to ask and answer technical questions. It is a practical guide since it describes scenarios that hackers wuld encounter.

Additional suggestions I would contribute are:
  - asking follow up or clarifcation questions to ensure that you understand the original posed question
  - acknowledge the individual for having the courage to ask the question in the first place
  - maintain eye contact when you answer the question

### (4) Read Chapter 3 of Free Culture
My reaction to this section is that what happened to Jesse Jordan is very unfortunate. He was a student at RPI who was working on a project to experiment and tinker. I believe that he did not intend to purposefully violate copyright. This example exposes the problem that large corporations can go after individuals with little consequences. Although the individual is able to fight, it is oftentimes better not to due to financial limitations and the fact that it can go on for an extended time period. While the large company can afford to keep throwing money and lawyers at the problem, an undergraduate student is not able to match that intensity. Therefore, this reveals an issue surrounding open source - it does not match the ideals of capitalism. What is motivating people to keep contributing to open source initiatives when there is no compensation and there is potential for liability.

## Part 6 - Reflection
An open source project that I think is interesting and might be interesting to evaluate is detextify. The project is a LaTeX symbol classifier as a web service. I think the project is interesting because it is a helpful resource for people learning LaTeX for the first time. I knew about this project because I actually used it for a different course, but I learned today that it was open source when I started looking into it more. The project seems to only have 2 contributors at the moment, so there does not seem to be a large community of developers for it.
Github Link: https://github.com/kirel/detexify

I think it is important to contribute to open source and I have in the past with two different projects through RCOS.
